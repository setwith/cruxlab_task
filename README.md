# Password Validator

## Overview

This repository contains two projects that solve the task of validating passwords. One project is implemented using the Ruby programming language and runs as a console application, while the other project is built with the Ruby on Rails framework and operates in a web environment.

The Ruby project provides a command-line interface for validating passwords. It reads password requirements and passwords from a file and determines the validity of each password based on the provided criteria.

The Ruby on Rails project offers a web-based solution for validating passwords. It allows users to upload a file containing password requirements and passwords through a web form. The application then processes the file and displays the count of valid passwords on the web page.
